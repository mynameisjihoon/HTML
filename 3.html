JavaScript [10] often abbreviated as JS,
<br>is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
<br>[11] JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled and multi-paradigm.
<br>It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation 
<br>and first-class functions.
<br>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies
<br>of the World Wide Web.[12] Over 97% of websites use it client-side 
<br>for web page behavior,[13] often incorporating third-party libraries.
<br>[14] All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine 
<br>to execute the code on the user's device.
<br>As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, 
<br>functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming
<br>interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions,
<br>standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
