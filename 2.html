Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet 
<br>language used for describing the presentation of a 
<br>document written in a markup language such as HTML. 
<br>[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, 
<br>alongside HTML and JavaScript.
<br>[2] CSS is designed to enable the separation of 
<br>presentation and content, including layout, colors,
<br>and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content 
<br>accessibility; provide more flexibility and control 
<br>in the specification of presentation characteristics;
<br>enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying
<br>the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity
<br>and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file 
<br>to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that 
<br>share the file and its formatting.
